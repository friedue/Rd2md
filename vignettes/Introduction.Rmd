# Reference Manual To PDF

The Reference Manual of a package exported as PDF is an R command shipped with R.

```
R CMD Rd2pdf
```

However, pdf versions are quite static and nothing can really be done with it. 

The single .Rd files are well structured and can easily parsed to .md files. Thanks to [jbryer]('https://github.com/jbryer/Rd2markdown') to publish the relevant code.

This fact is used to replicate a Reference Manual in markdown format.

# Reference Manual To Markdown

There main function to create the reference manual in markdown format is

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ReferenceManual(pkg, outdir = getwd(), verbose=FALSE)
```

For the `pkg_` variable, provide the full **file path** of the source code of the package.

Be aware that this uses **source** code only. This means, it will look into the `man` directory of your package source and take all `.Rd` files into considerations.
